### Convolutional neural network to classify digit images

## Technical dependencies:

- Anaconda
- Jupyter notebook
- Tensorflow
- GPU drivers

## Steps to import the project

The project was built using anaconda, the list of dependencies required for the program is present in "environment.yml" file.

1) Download environment.yml and MNIST_test.ipynb files.

2) Open up a command prompt pointing to location of the downloaded files.

3) Run the following commands

    Create the course environment

        conda env create
    wait for the environment to create.

    Activate the environment (Mac/Linux)

        source activate ztdl
    Activate the environment (Windows)

        activate ztdl
    Check that your prompt changed to

        (ztdl) $
    Launch Jupyter Notebook

        jupyter notebook
    Open your browser to

        http://localhost:8888

4) Open the MNIST_test.ipynb file and run the script
